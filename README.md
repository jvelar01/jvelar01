Hello, I am Joaqu√≠n Velarde Noval, a final year Mathematics student specialized in Computer Science with a background in programming, algorithms, and data analysis.


In this GitHub profile, I am going to post some projects I have worked on during my studies, covering various subjects such as Algorithm Design or Concurrent Programming.
